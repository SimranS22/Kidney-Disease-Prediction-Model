# Kidney Disease Prediction Model with Machine Learning Algorithms

## Objective of the Project 
The primary objective of creating the kidney disease prediction model is to develop a robust and accurate tool for early detection and risk assessment of heart diseases. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model aims to analyze diverse medical parameters and provide timely predictions, enabling proactive healthcare interventions. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance preventive care strategies and contribute to better patient outcomes by identifying potential kidney-related risks in advance.
